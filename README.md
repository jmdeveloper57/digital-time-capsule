Digital Time Capsule
This project is a web application that allows users to create and securely store messages and images in a digital "time capsule." The content is sealed and can only be accessed on a specific future date chosen by the creator.

The app is designed as a single, self-contained HTML file for easy sharing and deployment.

Features
Message Capsules: Users can compose and seal personal messages or letters for the future.

Image Capsules: The app supports creating capsules filled with up to 5 images, perfect for preserving photo memories.

Scheduled Delivery: Each capsule is locked until a specific, user-defined date and time.

Secure Sharing: After creation, the app provides a unique, shareable link that can be sent to recipients or saved for later.

Real-Time Status: A live countdown timer shows viewers exactly how long until a capsule can be opened.

User Dashboard: Users can sign in with their email and password to view and manage all the capsules they have created.

Secure Storage: The application uses Firebase Firestore for persistent and secure data storage.

How to Run
This is a single-file web application, which means you do not need a web server or any complex setup.

Download the file: Save the digital_time_capsule.html file to your computer.

Open in a browser: Simply open the file directly in any modern web browser (like Chrome, Firefox, or Edge).

The application will load and function as intended.

Technologies Used
HTML, JavaScript (Plain JS): The core of the application's structure and logic.

Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework used for all styling and a responsive design.

Firebase Firestore: The cloud-hosted NoSQL database used for storing all time capsule data.

Firebase Authentication: Used to securely manage user sign-in and sign-up with email and password.
